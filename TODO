List of to-dos:

* Check if a PPA already exists in the system before adding it.
* Check if the software is already installed in the system before running the
  apt-get commands.
* Check if the ZNC directory exists already or not, remove if it does.
* Check if the already installed GCC/G++ version is 4.7+.  If it is newer than
  4.7, don't force it to be installed.  If it is 4.7, do nothing.  If older, 
  then we need to install at least 4.7.
